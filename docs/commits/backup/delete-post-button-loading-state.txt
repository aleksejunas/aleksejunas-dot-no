feat: add loading state to DeletePostButton for better UX

- Added loading state tracking with useState and useTransition hooks
- Button now shows "Sletter..." text and gets disabled during deletion
- Prevents multiple clicks and provides clear visual feedback
- Updated ActionButton to support disabled prop
- Added CSS styles for disabled button state
- Works with both ActionButton style and simple button style variants

This improves the user experience by providing clear feedback during the
asynchronous deletion process and prevents accidental multiple submissions.
