feat: consolidate delete blog post buttons into unified DeletePostButton component

This commit addresses the confusion caused by having 3 different delete implementations by consolidating them into a single, flexible DeletePostButton component that supports both ActionButton styling and traditional text buttons.

## Changes Made:
- Enhanced DeletePostButton component with ActionButton support via useActionButtonStyle prop
- Removed 3 duplicate delete buttons from blog post page, consolidating to single implementation
- Updated admin blog page to use consistent DeletePostButton component
- Fixed action prop usage to use deletePostAction instead of raw deletePost function
- Maintained confirmation dialogs on all delete operations for safety
- Cleaned up unused imports and functions

## Benefits:
✅ Consistent UI/UX across all delete operations
✅ Single source of truth for delete functionality  
✅ Flexible styling options (prominent ActionButton or subtle text button)
✅ Proper confirmation dialogs prevent accidental deletions
✅ Cleaner, more maintainable codebase

## Files Modified:
- src/components/buttons/DeletePostButton.tsx
- src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
- src/app/admin/blog/page.tsx
- docs/project-map.md

## Usage:
// Prominent delete button
<DeletePostButton postId={post.id} action={deletePostAction} useActionButtonStyle={true} />

// Subtle delete button  
<DeletePostButton postId={post.id} action={deletePostAction} useActionButtonStyle={false} />
